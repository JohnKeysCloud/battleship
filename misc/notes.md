# Notes

## 10/15/24

If I want to keep the game playable in the terminal, with the boards already
randomized, I can:

1. Have the user input coordinates of the ship they wish to place
2. Check those coordinates against the occupied positions on the gameboard
3. Return the ship that occupies that position.

From there I can retrieve from the user, the set of coordinates at which the
user wants to place the bow of the ship and in what orientation. This would
either be successful or face rejection depending on the configurations they select.

For the UI, the user would be hovering over the gameboard and if they click a
ship, it will reorient (if possible). If they click and drag, the ship will
move, and only be placed if hovering over a coordinate for the bow that allows
the space for the rest of the ship to reside.

What is the common core logic?

## 10/26/24 - Piece Rotation Thoughts & Spaghetti Implementation

ðŸ’­ Some ground rules

- I will need to remove the ship without changing the initial value
  - Place it at 90 degrees from original (if possible)
  - If not, place it at 180 degrees
  - If not, place it at 270 degrees
  - If not, blink red to signify that it can't be rotated.
  - If it can only fit in one of the 3 different orientations, running function
  should have the position alternate between the 2 states.

ðŸ’­ Some logic (will require bound & coordinate occupation checks)

- 90 degree rotation from og position - horizontal
- Same coordinates, different orientation ðŸš¬
- 180 rotation from og position - horizontal
- Shift bow placement of `x - shipLength - 1`
- Old bow coordinates becomes new stern coordinates

### 180 Degree Rotation Walkthrough

ðŸŸ¢ ship.length === 3 | [x,y] => [4,0], [5,0], [6,0]

before:
[x,x,x,x,o,o,o,x,x,x]

after:
[x,x,o,o,o,x,x,x,x,x]

"New x value (left shift) 2 units for bow coordinates (ship length - 1),
old bow becomes new stern"

ðŸŸ¢ ship length === 5 | [x,y] => [2,0], [3,0], [4,0], [5,0], [6,0]

before:
[x,x,o,o,o,o,o,x,x,x]
(Out of bounds)

ðŸŸ¢ ship length === 5 | [x,y] => [5,0], [6,0], [7,0], [8,0], [9,0]

before:
[x,x,x,x,x,o,o,o,o,o]
after:
[x,o,o,o,o,o,x,x,x,x]

"New x value (left shift) 4 units for bow coordinates (ship length - 1)"

### 270 Degree Rotation Walkthrough

- 270 rotation from original position - horizontal
- New bow coordinates are old bow/new stern coordinates `y - shipLength - 1`
- New stern coordinates becomes old bow coordinates

### Rotational Logic Application v1

Rotated Piece Placement Parameters

```typescript
const rotatedPiecePlacementParams = {
  90: {
    bowCoordinates: isHorizontal
      ? rotationalPivotBowCoordinates
      : rotationalPivotBowCoordinates.map((coord, i) =>
          i === 0 ? applyOffsetToCoordinate(coord) : coord
        ),
    orientation: isHorizontal ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal',
  },
  180: {
    bowCoordinates: rotationalPivotBowCoordinates.map((coord, i) =>
      (isHorizontal && i === 0) || (!isHorizontal && i === 1)
        ? applyOffsetToCoordinate(coord)
        : coord
    ),
    orientation: isHorizontal ? 'horizontal' : 'vertical',
  },
  270: {
    bowCoordinates: isHorizontal
      ? rotationalPivotBowCoordinates.map((coord, i) =>
          i === 1 ? applyOffsetToCoordinate(coord) : coord
        )
      : rotationalPivotBowCoordinates,
    orientation: isHorizontal ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal',
  },
};

console.log(rotatedPiecePlacementParams);
```

```typescript
// before:
if (
  (RotationOrNull === 180 && !isHorizontal) ||
  (RotationOrNull === 270 && isHorizontal)
) {
  return [x, applyOffsetToCoordinate(y)];
} else {
  return [applyOffsetToCoordinate(x), y];
}

// Patterns Observed
  // No coordinate change:
    // 90Â° when horizontal
    // 270Â° when vertical

  // Offset y-coordinate only:
    // 180Â° when vertical
    // 270Â° when horizontal

  // Offset x-coordinate only:
    // 180Â° when horizontal
    // 90Â° when vertical

// Optimized Calulation:

const offsetCoordinate = isHorizontal
  ? applyOffsetToCoordinate(x)
  : applyOffsetToCoordinate(y);

return isHorizontal
  ? RotationOrNull === 180
    ? [offsetCoordinate, y]
    : [x, offsetCoordinate]
  : RotationOrNull === 180
  ? [x, offsetCoordinate]
  : [offsetCoordinate, y];
```

## 1/27/25 Functional Programming

```typescript
// Utility function to create a board of given size filled with zeros
const createBoard = (size) =>
  Array.from({ length: size }, () => Array(size).fill(0));

// Utility function to update a cell's value
const updateCell = (board, row, col, value) =>
  board.map((r, i) =>
    r.map((cell, j) => (i === row && j === col ? value : cell))
  );

// Utility function to retrieve a cell's value
const getCell = (board, row, col) => board[row][col];

// Example usage
const boardSize = 10;
let board = createBoard(boardSize);

console.log('Initial Board:');
console.table(board);

board = updateCell(board, 1, 2, 42);
console.log('Board after updating cell (1, 2) to 42:');
console.table(board);

const value = getCell(board, 1, 2);
console.log(`Value at cell (1, 2): ${value}`);
```

## 2/1/25 `readyUp()` (...and beyond) Roadmap

### Iteration 1

1. This component needs to lock the gameboard
   a. On fleet lock, stop animation and remove event listeners.

2. Move to next phase of game
   a. On fleet lock, show either "finding an opponent" or, if
   playing a bot show a shuffler animation that
   randomize who will go first and show user an animation of
   the shuffler (finding an opponent will lead to the same
   animation). Make it last precisely 3 seconds.
   If opponent goes first, leave position of gameboards in UI
   If player goes first, move player gameboard down as
   opponent gameboard moves up [use translate 3d combined with
   precise opacity transitions with z-index swap to make
   opponent board click-able ( on attack)].

b. Create the above mentioned 'opponent turn' UI state and
depending on turn state, toggle between the two with a
smooth animation (i,e, player to opponent turn and vice
vice versa).

### Iteration 2

Methods of public `readyUp()` method which will call other methods
private methods such as:

1. `lockGameBoard()`;
2. `randomizeTurnState()`;
3. `animateTurnState()`;
    a. If player goes first, animate to: `playerTurnState: 'player'`;
    Initial state is opponent turn state, so no animation needed if
    opponent goes first.
4. Attach listeners to opponent gameboard
    a. Toggle board pointer events (key in `bellumState`). This toggle
    will remove/add the classes to the gameboard elements that move
    active board up and down (or however I decided to animate it).

If opponent goes first, show "Your `opp(osition)` is preparing  
 to fire...". This animation should show for `x` seconds if playing a
bot or until the opposition makes a selection of a grid to attack.

This will be in the `bellum` fragment of the main container one hot
swap container.

After selection is made (or 3 seconds have passed), the gameboard
UI will update to reflect the attack [dot if empty grid cell or
add `cooked` class to ship unit that was hit (and increment its hit counter)].

Toggle event listeners depending on the turn state.
Animate ship opacity to 0 if fully cooked (sunk):

```typescript
interface GameState {
 playerTurnState: 'null' | 'player' |'opponent'; // null initially
 gamePhase: 'parabellum' | 'bellum' | 'postBellum', // `parabellum` initially
 . . .
}
```

**Note:** Some of the above is out of scope for this component, such as
gameboard updates and animations. This component will only handle
the locking of the gameboard and the transition to the next phase of the game.
