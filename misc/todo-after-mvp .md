# Ticket: Refactor Class Names with Architectural Postfixes

## Description

We aim to enhance the readability and maintainability of the project by refining class names to better reflect their architectural roles. Postfixes will be applied based on the architectural styles identified during development. This will ensure consistency, improve code clarity, and align with established software engineering patterns.

---

### 1. Refactor `DomController` Class

- **New Name:** `DomService` or `DomManager`
- **Reasoning:** The class acts as a **service locator** for UI components, centralizing their management and providing access to them. Using `Service` or `Manager` reflects its role in managing and coordinating DOM-related functionality.

### 2. Refactor `CycloneSitRepScroller` Class

- **New Name:** `CycloneSitRepComponent` (or `CycloneSitRepWidget`)
- **Reasoning:** This is a **UI element** that interacts with the game's state. The term `Component` aligns it with common UI component naming conventions. `Widget` could also be used if the class represents a more interactive UI element, but `Component` is preferable for clarity.

### 3. Refactor `MainComponent` Class

- **New Name:** `MainController` or `MainManager`
- **Reasoning:** The class acts as the **primary orchestrator** of the game's state and UI components. Using `Controller` or `Manager` reflects its role in coordinating and managing the overall game logic and interactions.

### 4. General Naming Conventions

- **Services**: Classes that manage logic and provide shared access to components.
  - Example: `DomService`, `GameStateService`

- **Controllers**: Classes that orchestrate and manage the interaction between different components and services.
  - Example: `MainController`, `GameController`

- **Components**: UI-related classes that represent various elements within the user interface.
  - Example: `CycloneSitRepComponent`, `ShipGridComponent`

- **Factories**: Classes responsible for creating and managing instances of objects.
  - Example: `GameObjectFactory`, `ComponentFactory`

### Benefits of This Refactor

- **Consistency:** The naming conventions will ensure that roles and responsibilities of each class are clear.
- **Maintainability:** With clearer names, future developers (or even yourself in the future) will understand the architecture faster.
- **Scalability:** These names are flexible and will easily scale as the project evolves, making it easier to add new components or services as needed.

## Action Items

1. Review the existing classes and identify any that fit the patterns described.
2. Apply the appropriate postfixes based on the class responsibilities.
3. Ensure that the refactor does not break existing functionality, and update documentation where necessary.
