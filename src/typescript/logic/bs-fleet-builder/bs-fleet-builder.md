### `class BattleshipFleetBuilder`

#### `private constructor(private fleet: Fleet)` Constructor

The `private` keyword in the constructor of a class declaration means that instances of the class cannot be created directly from outside the class using the `new` keyword. Instead, the class must provide static methods or properties to control how instances are created.

In the parameters of the constructor is `fleet`, a private, read-only property that must conform to the [`Fleet`](../types/logic-types.md#fleet-type-with-side-notes) type. This type defines an object where the keys are specific ship types (e.g., `carrier`, `battleship`, etc.) and the values are instances of the `BattleshipBuilder` class. The property being private means it encapsulates and protects the internal state of the `BattleshipFleetBuilder` class. This means that it can only be accessed or modified from within the class, preventing external code from directly altering the fleet's data. This design pattern helps maintain the integrity of the fleet by controlling access through specific methods like `getShip`.

**Side Effects of a Private Constructor**

1. **Controlled Instantiation**:
   - By making the constructor private, the class ensures that it cannot be instantiated directly by users of the class. This allows for strict control over how instances are created.

2. **Design Pattern Implementation**:
   - This design is useful for implementing certain design patterns. In the case of the `BattleshipFleetBuilder`, only predefined static methods (`createHasbroFleet` and `createMBFleet`) are used to create instances. These methods enforce specific rules or configurations for fleet creation.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - The private constructor encapsulates the instantiation logic and state management within the class. It prevents the creation of instances with invalid or inconsistent state, ensuring that all instances adhere to the expected configuration.

4. **Abstraction of Fleet Creation**:
   - For the Battleship game, where there are predefined fleet compositions, the private constructor abstracts the complexity of fleet creation. Users interact with the class through static methods, which handle the instantiation details and ensure that only valid fleets are created according to the gameâ€™s rules.

In summary, the private constructor in `BattleshipFleetBuilder` is used to enforce controlled and consistent instantiation through static methods, aligning with the specific requirements of the Battleship game.

#### `private static createFleet` Method

##### Why it private?

It's a helper method that doesn't depend on the instances state, it does not need access to instance-specific data. Making it static allows it to be called without needing to create an instance. 

##### `createFleet` Parameter Explained

``` typescript
// Initial Paramater (Pre-refactor)
fleetConfigs: { [key in ShipType]?: { type: ShipType; version?: FleetVersion } }

// Refactored with `type` creation
type ShipConfig = {
  type: ShipType;
  version?: FleetVersion;
};

type FleetConfigs = {
  [key in ShipType]?: ShipConfig;
};

// New Parameter (Post-refactor)
fleetConfigs: FleetConfigs
```

This method accepts an object `fleetConfigs` where:

- **Keys**: Must be one of the values defined in `ShipType` (e.g., `'carrier' | 'battleship' | 'destroyer' | 'submarine' | 'cruiser' | 'patrolBoat'`).
- **Values**: Each value is an object with:
  - A required `type` property of type `ShipType`.
  - An optional `version` property of type `FleetVersion` (e.g., `1990 | 2002`).

The use of optional properties means that not all ship types need to be included.

##### Logic

``` typescript
const fleet: Fleet = {};
const isShipType = (shipType: string): shipType is ShipType => {
  return Object.values(ShipType).includes(shipType as ShipType);
};

for (const [shipType, config] of Object.entries(fleetConfigs)) {
  if (config && isShipType(shipType)) {
    fleet[shipType] = new BattleshipBuilder(config.type, config.version);
  }
}

return fleet;
```

1. **Initialization**: `fleet` is initialized as an empty object conforming to the `Fleet` type.

2. **Destructuring with `Object.entries`**: Iterates over `fleetConfigs`, extracting `shipType` (key) and `config` (value) pairs, allowing the `for...of` loop to process each entry.

3. **Populating `fleet`**: In each iteration, `shipType` is cast to `ShipType` and set as a key on `fleet`, with its value being a new `BattleshipBuilder` instance created using the corresponding `config` values (`type` and `version`).

#### Static Methods: `createHasbroFleet()` and `createMBFleet()`

These static methods provide controlled ways to create instances of the class since the constructor is private and cannot be accessed directly. The `new` keyword is used internally within these methods, ensuring that instances are created according to the class's rules while preventing direct instantiation from outside the class.

Both methods return values that automatically conform to the `BattleshipFleetBuilder` class since they instantiate the class directly. The primary difference between the methods lies in their ship configurations: Hasbro's (2002) fleet setup differs from Milton Bradley's (1990). The specific configuration differences are outside the scope of this documentation. Read the code, or read here: [Battleship Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

#### Instance Methods

##### `getShip`

This method simply retrieves one of the ships of a fleet. It's parameter accepts a type of ship that conforms to an enumeration. This means that the carrier ship of a fleet is accessible via `ShipType.carrier`. 

Since the method must return an instance of the `BattleshipBuilder`, it must ensure that the ship is defined, hence the conditional check. TypeScript's typing system would throw an error otherwise.

### `createBattleshipFleetBuilderSet` Factory Function

This factory function creates an object containing player one's and player two's fleets depending on the version (i.e, Hasbro - 2002 and Milton Bradley - 1990). It accepts the version _year_ in its parameters.
