# Battleship

### What & Why  

A web implementation of the classic [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship) board game. Developed as a contribution to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) as an eloquent solution to [Project: Battleship](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship), the final project of their JavaScript curriculum.

### Note:  
```typescript
<---
Every line of code was written with love in NYC. Circa **2024/2025** ♥ —  

As we transition into the era of AI, projects like these remind us of 
the hands-on craft and creativity that shaped the past. Even now, with 
all the GPTs, not one line in this repository was copy/paste code. 
Every key... every value.  

Consider this a hieroglyph.  

I hope you're having a lovely day/evening.  

Also, remember _why_ you learned how to code.  

**You wanted to build cool stuff. 💭**  

That's a note to self ⤴️
