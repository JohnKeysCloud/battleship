## FAQ

### Why Are Code Comments Scarce

This project is designed to educate developers transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript by demonstrating best practices in code organization and readability.

#### 1. Focus on Readability Through Naming

All _variables_ and _functions_ are intentionally named to make the code self-explanatory. The goal is to make it easy to read and understand what each part of the code does without needing extensive in-line comments.

#### 2. Separate Documentation for Enhanced Learning

Instead of cluttering the code with comments, this project uses separate, comprehensive documentation for each module. This approach allows for deeper explanations not only of the code's functionality but also of TypeScript concepts, design choices, and advanced features. The documentation aims to:

- Bridge the gap for those transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- Provide insights into modern development tools and practices (e.g., NPM, Webpack, Jest).
- Serve as a thorough reference for understanding both the "why" and "how" behind the code.

#### 3. How to Use the Documentation and Code Together

For the best learning experience, it's recommended to read the documentation in parallel with exploring the code. Open the code and its corresponding documentation side by side to fully grasp the rationale behind each decision and to see TypeScript features in action.

Separating the documentation, was to ensure that the code remained clean and maintainable while still providing all the necessary context and learning material in a structured format.
